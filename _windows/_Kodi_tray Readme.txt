(I suppose) *Use at your own risk*


This runs Kodi and has various shortcuts and tools.

It will copy itself into your startup dir to run on each boot unless you specify in the ini.

You can set your email and pass as a hotkey for control v in addon_data

If you don't trust it, don't use it.  I made it, it's for me, and i know what it does.  Any problems are on your end.
